# Exercice 1

In this exercice, we need to create the add-page of the TagBeSill project.

This page must display a form, with the following fields :
 * addProject\_title 		a text field
 * addProject\_description 	a textarea field
 * addProject\_image 		a file field
 * addProject\_csrf\_token	an hidden field
 
A csrf token must be generated and inserted as the addProject\_csrf\_token field value

To validate it, just cd into the exercice folder and run "php phpunit-6.5.5.phar".
